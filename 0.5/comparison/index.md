# Why Purgatory, and how it compares

*As of October 2026. What is said about other products comes from the public sources listed at the bottom, and can change quickly.*

## What Purgatory is for

**A place where a team's apps run: the ones people build with AI agents or vibe-code in an afternoon.** Everyone gets their own space, every app gets a URL colleagues can open, and what nobody uses costs nothing. On your own server, not in someone else's cloud.

Think of it as **a self-hosted Vercel or Railway for the whole team**: you hand an agent a `p7y.env`, it deploys a `docker-compose.yml`, and a minute later `https://shop-web.example.com` works.

## How teams do this today, and what goes wrong

| Today                                                       | What goes wrong                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **It runs on someone's laptop**                             | No URL to show it, it stops when the lid closes, and it only works on that machine.                                                                                                                                                              |
| **A cloud PaaS** (Vercel, Railway, Render, Fly.io, Netlify) | Every experiment is another project on the bill; code and data leave the company network; a multi-container stack (app + database + worker) has to be rebuilt service by service; Vercel runs request-driven functions, not always-on processes. |
| **One shared VPS with Docker or Portainer**                 | Everyone is on one Docker daemon: they see each other's containers, ports collide, one runaway stack slows everyone down, one wrong `docker rm` hits someone else.                                                                               |
| **Coolify or Dokploy**                                      | Built for running a team's production apps: an admin sets up projects, everything keeps running all the time, teams on one server still share the daemon.                                                                                        |
| **A VM for everyone**                                       | Expensive while idle, and someone has to create, patch and clean up every one of them.                                                                                                                                                           |

## What Purgatory does instead

- **Self-service, like a cloud PaaS.** Anyone signs in (Google or any OIDC) and creates a sandbox; a quota and CPU / memory limits keep one person from taking the whole server.
- **Its own Docker for everyone.** Every sandbox has its own Docker daemon: what an agent produces (`docker-compose.yml` with app, database, cache) runs as it is, and nobody sees or breaks anyone else's containers.
- **A URL for every app, automatically.** Whatever a sandbox publishes gets `https://<name>-<app>.<domain>`; databases and SSH get a TLS address on port 443. No DNS, no proxy rules per app.
- **Idle costs nothing.** A sandbox without traffic falls asleep and wakes on the next request; after a longer sleep its containers are freed. Twenty experiments, three in use: the server carries three.
- **Made for coding agents.** **Copy as .env** or **Export for coding agents…** gives the agent a token for that one sandbox, Docker access from outside and a registry login; every pushed image is scanned for secrets before anyone can pull it anonymously.
- **Your server, your data, no bill per app.** One `docker compose up` on one Linux host, also inside a company network; no paid edition.
- **Nothing is lost.** Delete archives the sandbox's configuration and data.

## Against a cloud PaaS (Vercel, Railway, Render, Fly.io)

Purgatory gives a team what these give one developer, on hardware the team already has.

| What you pay for                 | Every project, service and its usage                                                                                            | The server                                                            |
| What you deploy                  | Mostly one service per app (Vercel: request-driven functions, also from a Dockerfile); Fly.io's Docker Compose support is basic | A whole `docker-compose.yml`, as it is, with its own Docker daemon    |
| Idle apps                        | Railway, Render (free tier) and Fly.io can scale to zero; otherwise they run and are billed                                     | Sleep by default, wake on the next request                            |
| Many people on one account       | A team plan; everyone sees the team's projects                                                                                  | Everyone sees only their own sandboxes; tokens limited to one sandbox |
| Production features              | Global edge, autoscaling, managed databases, backups, zero operations                                                           | None of these: one host, you run it                                   |

**Pick a cloud PaaS** for an app in production that has to scale and be up at 3 a.m. without you. **Pick Purgatory** for the many apps before that point: experiments, demos, internal tools, vibe-coded apps, test environments, and for whatever must not leave the company network.

## Against self-hosted tools (Coolify, Dokploy, Portainer)

These also run on your own server, but they are built for **one team running its apps**, not for **many people each having their own space**.

On a shared Docker daemon, anyone who may deploy an arbitrary compose file can, for example, bind-mount host paths or attach to another project's network: the separation in the dashboard does not reach the daemon.

**They work well together:** try and build in a Purgatory sandbox, push the image to its registry, run it in production with Coolify or Dokploy. A Purgatory sandbox can also have its own Portainer (the `portainer` template), for that sandbox's daemon alone.

## Looks similar, does a different job

These come up in the same searches ("sandbox", "dev environment", "AI agent"), but they solve another problem:

- **Coder, GitHub Codespaces, Gitpod / Ona, DevPod:** a workspace for **writing code** (an IDE, a repo, a terminal), not a place where the finished app keeps running for others. They fit next to Purgatory: write in Coder or on the laptop, run in Purgatory.
- **E2B, Daytona, Docker Sandboxes, Modal, Northflank sandboxes, kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox, Alibaba OpenSandbox:** they let an agent **execute code** in an isolated box for minutes or hours, driven from an SDK, usually inside a microVM. None of them is meant to keep a team's app online at a URL for weeks.

## Where Purgatory is weaker

1. **Isolation is not yet a boundary against hostile code.** The `dind` runtime runs the sandbox `privileged`: root inside a sandbox can escape to the host. That is fine for colleagues and their own agents, not for strangers. The `sysbox` runtime removes `privileged` and is used in production, but still shares the host's kernel; a **Kata Containers** runtime, a lightweight VM with its own kernel per sandbox, is on the [roadmap](https://csakaszamok.github.io/p7y/0.5/roadmap/index.md).
1. **One host for now.** No multi-host scheduling and no warm pool; a new sandbox takes 20–60 seconds, a wake from deep sleep about 30. **Kubernetes support** is on the roadmap.
1. **Sleep stops the containers.** On wake the stack restarts by its restart policies; what was only in memory is gone.
1. **Missing pieces:** no teams yet (a sandbox has one owner), no hard disk quota (only a warning above a disk limit; CPU and memory limits exist), no egress rules, no SDK (a REST API, the Docker CLI and [agent-guide.md](https://csakaszamok.github.io/p7y/0.5/agent-guide/index.md)).
1. **A young, small project:** no community yet, no external security audit.

## When to choose something else

- **Production that must scale and stay up without you** → a cloud PaaS, or Coolify / Dokploy on your own servers.
- **Untrusted code from strangers** (public sign-up) → a microVM sandbox (E2B, Docker Sandboxes, Northflank), until Purgatory has a Kata runtime.
- **Writing code in a cloud IDE** → Coder or Codespaces.
- **An agent running short scripts from an SDK** → E2B, Daytona or agent-sandbox.
- **GPU or ML work** → Modal.
